If you're interested in learning Ember.js, I'm happy to announce that I'm partnering
with my friends at [Unspace](http://unspace.ca) to teach an introductory class on
Saturday September 13th here in Toronto.

We did one of these last year and it was super fun. This time around we're just
focusing on the beginner stuff, so if you or anyone you know are new to Ember.js,
you should check it out.

All the information you need is on the [Embergarten](https://unspace.ca/embergarten/)
website!
